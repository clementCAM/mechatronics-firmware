Design Summary

Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :  33

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:MapLib:979 - LUT6 symbol
   "U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O11" (output
   signal=U0/U_ICON/iTDO_next) has input signal "CONTROL0<3>" which will be
   trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report File for details about why the input
   signal will become undriven.
ERROR:MapLib:978 - LUT6 symbol
   "U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O11" (output
   signal=U0/U_ICON/iTDO_next) has an equation that uses input pin I4, which no
   longer has a connected signal. Please ensure that all the pins used in the
   equation for this LUT have signals that are not trimmed (see Section 5 of the
   Map Report File for details on which signals were trimmed).

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  64 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
  51 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
